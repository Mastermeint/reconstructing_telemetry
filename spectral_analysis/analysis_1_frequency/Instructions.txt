1) Load the function.py file into your directory.
2) Make sure that you have the csv files needed.
3) Use compute_spectral_frequencies.py to compute
the spectral frequencies.
4) Use spectral_cluster.py to create the clusters.
5) Use analysis_spectral_cluster.py to compute some statistics.

The file experiments_time_series_anal.py contains some
tests concerning time serie analysis.

The other png and csv files are results.
