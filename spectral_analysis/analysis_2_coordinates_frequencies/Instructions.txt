1) Load the function.py file into your directory.
2) Make sure that you have the csv files needed.
3) Use compute_spectral_coordinates_freq.py to compute
the 2 main spectral coordinates.
4) Use spectral_cluster_coordinates.py to create the clusters.
5) Use analysis_multiple_spectral_cluster.py to compute some statistics.
6) Use spectral_coordinates_est_loads.py to compute the estimated loads profiles per each cluster.

The other png and csv files are results.
